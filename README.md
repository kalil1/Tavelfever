# README# TravelFever
TravelFever is a one of my personal projects. This application helps users prepare for Travel byy generating a checklist of items that you'll need on your trip based on the activities the user selected. This application uses Devise for user authentication and the OpenWheather Api the generate a forecast for the destination selected.
